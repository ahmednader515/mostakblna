# Role-Based Dashboard Redirection

This feature automatically redirects users to their appropriate dashboard based on their role after authentication.

## How it works

### User Roles
- **USER** (default): Students - redirected to `/dashboard`
- **TEACHER**: Teachers - redirected to `/dashboard/teacher/courses`
- **ADMIN**: Administrators - redirected to `/dashboard/admin/users`

### Implementation Details

1. **Sign-in Flow**: When users sign in successfully, they are automatically redirected to their role-specific dashboard
2. **Middleware Protection**: The middleware ensures users can only access routes appropriate for their role
3. **Main Dashboard Protection**: Non-student users trying to access `/dashboard` are redirected to their role-specific dashboard

### Files Modified

1. **`lib/utils.ts`**: Added `getDashboardUrlByRole()` utility function
2. **`middleware.ts`**: Updated to handle role-based redirections
3. **`app/dashboard/page.tsx`**: Added server-side role-based redirection
4. **`app/(auth)/(routes)/sign-in/page.tsx`**: Updated sign-in flow to redirect based on role

### Testing

To test the feature:

1. **For Teachers**: Sign in with a teacher account ‚Üí should redirect to `/dashboard/teacher/courses`
2. **For Admins**: Sign in with an admin account ‚Üí should redirect to `/dashboard/admin/users`
3. **For Students**: Sign in with a student account ‚Üí should redirect to `/dashboard`

### Console Logging

The implementation includes console logging to help debug:
- Role detection: `üîç getDashboardUrlByRole called with role: [ROLE]`
- Redirection: `üîç Redirecting to dashboard URL: [URL]`

### Security

- Users cannot access dashboards they don't have permission for
- Middleware enforces role-based access control
- Server-side validation ensures proper redirection

## Logout Functionality

### Implementation Details

1. **Universal Logout Button**: Added logout button to all navbar components
2. **Consistent Styling**: Red-colored logout button with hover effects
3. **Proper Redirection**: Logout redirects users to the home page (`/`)

### Components Updated

1. **`components/navbar-routes.tsx`**: Added logout button for dashboard users (removed role-specific buttons)
2. **`components/navbar.tsx`**: Added logout button for main site users
3. **`app/(course)/_components/course-navbar.tsx`**: Added logout button for course pages

### Features

- **Clean UI**: Removed teacher mode and admin mode buttons for cleaner interface
- **Enhanced Hover Effects**: Smooth transition animations on logout button hover
- **Consistent UI**: Same logout button styling across all components
- **Proper Session Handling**: Uses NextAuth's `signOut()` function with callback URL
- **Arabic Text**: "ÿ™ÿ≥ÿ¨ŸäŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿÆÿ±Ÿàÿ¨" (Logout) text for Arabic interface

### Testing

Use the `LogoutTest` component to verify logout functionality:
- Shows current user information
- Tests logout button functionality
- Provides console logging for debugging

## Balance Management Restrictions

### Implementation Details

1. **Student Restrictions**: Students (USER role) cannot add balance to their account
2. **UI Protection**: Add balance section is hidden for students in the balance page
3. **API Protection**: Server-side validation prevents students from adding balance programmatically
4. **Dynamic Descriptions**: Page description changes based on user role

### Components Updated

1. **`app/dashboard/(routes)/balance/page.tsx`**: Added role-based conditional rendering
2. **`app/api/balance/add/route.ts`**: Added role-based API protection
3. **`components/balance-test.tsx`**: Created test component for balance functionality

### Features

- **Role-Based UI**: Students see different interface than teachers/admins
- **API Security**: Server-side validation prevents unauthorized balance additions
- **Clear Messaging**: Students see appropriate description about balance viewing only
- **Transaction History**: All users can still view their transaction history

### Testing

Use the `BalanceTest` component to verify balance functionality:
- Shows current user role and permissions
- Tests balance addition for authorized users
- Shows appropriate messages for students
